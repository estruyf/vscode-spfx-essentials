# SharePoint Framework - Extension Pack for Visual Studio Code

This is an extension pack that contains useful extension for SharePoint Framework projects.

## Why this project?

The reason I created this project was that during courses and events, people often ask which extension I use in VSCode.

One time when I was presenting an Angular course. I discovered a useful extension called [Angular Essentials](https://github.com/johnpapa/vscode-angular-essentials). This gave me the idea to do the same for SPFx related projects.

## Changes

## Which extensions are included?

Currently the following extensions are included in the package:

[Auto Import](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=steoates.autoimport) - Automatically finds, parses and provides code actions and code completion for all available imports.

[Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) - Debug your JavaScript code running in Google Chrome from VS Code. You can find the configuration for this in the following article: [debug SharePoint Framework solutions in Visual Studio Code](https://dev.office.com/sharepoint/docs/spfx/debug-in-vscode)

[Editor Config](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) - EditorConfig for VS Code. This extension can maintain consistent settings between editors. By default, a new SPFx project will already contain a `.editorconfig` file.

[JSON to TS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MariusAlchimavicius.json-to-ts) - Converts JSON objects to TypeScript interfaces. This will save you a lot of time creating new interfaces.

[npm Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.npm-intellisense) - Visual Studio Code plugin that autocompletes npm modules in import statements. 

[Path Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense) - Visual Studio Code plugin that autocompletes filenames.

[SPFx Debug Configuration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eliostruyf.spfx-debug) - This extension contains the SharePoint Framework debugging configurations to debug your code in Visual Studio code.
